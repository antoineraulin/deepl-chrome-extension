DeepL extension for Chrome, Vivaldi, Opera, and probably other browsers based on Chromium.

If you're a Twitter Addict go look at this [extension](https://github.com/antoineraulin/twitter-deepl-translation).

## Installation
### Developer mode :
Open [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions) (vivaldi://extensions), activate the developer mode, click on "Load uncompressed extension...", and select the folder of the downloaded extension.

### With the compressed file .crx
Open [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions) (vivaldi://extensions), drag and drop the deepl.crx file into the extensions tab. Accept installation.

## Usage
Click on the DeepL icon in the status bar of the browser, click on "Translate". A pad appears indicating that the translation of the tab is in progress.

## Additional information :
This extension uses reverse engineering to communicate with DeepL's Api, so it is an undocumented Api. As a result, the methods employed may not be the most effective but have the merit of working. Linguee (editor of DeepL) can terminate this api at any time, or modify it. We are in no way affiliated with Linguee. This extension is unofficial.
